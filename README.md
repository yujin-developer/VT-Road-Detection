Vehicular Technology Team Project  
**Road Detection using SSD_VGG16 and RT-DETR**

---

## Overview

This repository contains the full pipeline for road detection(pothole, speedbump), comparing two object detection models:
- **SSD_VGG16** (Single Shot MultiBox Detector with VGG16 backbone)
- **RT-DETR** (Real-Time Detection Transformer, anchor-free, transformer-based)

All training, inference, evaluation, and visualization code is included, along with plots and sample results.
